HPC - Overview
----

Login:
```Linux
sh -Y <username>@login2.bc2.unibas.ch
```

Most of the "login nodes" are 16 core machines. If you want to run something with 8-12 threads for a few minutes to see how it behaves it's generally not a problem. We've restricted access to the nodes which are running critical software, like web services for external use. You can have a look at what's happening on the node you're on with the command top.

#### Environment Variable

  * $HOME     # home directory
  * $TMPDIR   # scratch storage
  * $USER     # name user
  * $PATH     # list of paths
  * $HOSTNAME # name of computer/server

#### ....

 qacct -j <jobid>


#### Group Folder on the HPC

The group folder is located here:

```Linux
cd /scicore/home/holmp/GROUP/
```

The following rules should be applied when using the GROUP directory:

  * this folder is manly for sharing files - please make sure the permissions are set correctly!
  * all members can contribute to the directory
  * only the owner of a directory or a file should make changes or delete it
  * keep a safe copy of each file you want to share
